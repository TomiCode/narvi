Evolved from being just an idea to a completed prototype design. This repository will contain schematics, rendered board views and also firmware sources with USB-HID driver apps to control some of the devices features from the user operating system.



## Introduction

**narvi** (*/ˈnɑːrvi/*) is a device that allows to share some USB enabled devices (like a keyboard, mice, serial port interfaces, etc.) with an integrated microSD card reader within just a tiny little box. Additionally it features a quick charge 3.0 front interface and an LED strip connector (for lighting the desk or whatever).

The idea to create such a device came from day to day usage of a Macbook with a desktop PC next to. Manually switching the keyboard or mice connection most of the time is a pain in the ass. This eliminates such annoyances and allows to switch the host connection with just a button press (later on probably with a shortcut in the operating system, without even touching the device). Additionally it features an integrated microSD card reader for the selected host and an USB charger upfront with quick charge 3.0 capable interface without disturbing any of the USB communications.
